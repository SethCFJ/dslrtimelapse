# Timelapse Project

## Purpose

This project features a Python script that automates time-lapse photography using the gphoto2 library. The script captures images at predefined intervals and organises them into folders on a rasberry pi (or any linux system). Scheduling is managed by a cronjob (example included below) allowing the script to run at specific times automatically. Future enchancments of this project will include an additional script that uploads captured images to an ftp server.
